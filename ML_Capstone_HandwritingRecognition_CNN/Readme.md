# Capstone Project

Train a convolutional neural network to recognize the MNIST handwritten digits. You may obtain the training and test sets from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Your implementation will be judged on the following criteria, as evinced from Matlab outputs.  

a) Complexity of the network in terms of number of learnable parameters.  
b) Training time  
c) Training and testing accuracies  
d) Live demo that includes capture and detection of handwritten digits. This criterion will be weighed the highest.  

This is a group project. No more than three students are to form a group and make a single submission.
